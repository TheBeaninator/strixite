// qwen4_exp QSA indexer on the GPU: which
// keys each query of a full-attention layer attends to. The indexer's queries come from the merged
// q|k|v|indexer projection through qk_norm_rope (kernels/attention.hpp: per-head RMSNorm_zc + partial RoPE,
// any head dim); these kernels do the rest:
//
//   qsa_block_keys: when a 4-token block completes, its key K_b = RoPE(RMSNorm_zc(mean of its 4 raw keys))
//     at position 4b (mean in FP32, cast to the activation dtype, as the reference) goes into the block-key
//     cache; the raw keys of the still incomplete block carry over in a tail buffer (<= 3 rows) - the
//     engine option of the arch doc: 128 values per 4 tokens instead of every raw key.
//   qsa_scores: score[t, b] = (1/sqrt(D)) sum_h relu(q_h . K_b), FP32, for the query's complete blocks
//     b < (pos + 1) / 4.
//   qsa_topk: the min(k, #blocks) highest-scoring blocks per query (a set; ties to the lower block index,
//     as the reference's stable order), k = budget / 4 = 512 on the target.
// The attended keys are then the selected blocks' tokens plus the query's (pos + 1) mod 4 tail tokens.
//
// Block-key cache layout: chunk-major - element d of block b at ((d / 8) * cap_blocks + b) * 8 + d % 8 -
// so the score kernel's lanes (one block each) read one contiguous run per 16-byte load.

// more than k blocks - three histogram passes, the select, a per-row sort - else 1), for many queries (prefill);
// Row - one workgroup per query, one launch (the passes over the row in LDS, the select in index order so no

// rows of at most kQsaTopkRowMaxBlocks blocks (any T: prefill chunks too, 3-8x faster than Split there), Coop for small T past that (the split's
// workgroups in one cooperative launch: grid syncs between the passes, a select in index order - no sort); tests force

// Row 6.9 / 8.6 / 14.3 / 29.4 us at 1k / 4k / 16k / 32k blocks; T = 5 14.6 at 16k, 55.4 at 32k - so Row up to 16384

// doesn't touch the workspace; Coop's per-workgroup counts are rewritten each call). Not shared between concurrent
// calls.
// Filter (many queries past kQsaTopkRowMaxBlocks: deep prefill chunks; Auto there): a bound from ~1/16 of the row,
// one pass keeping the blocks at or above it, the exact select on those - the row read about once instead of four
