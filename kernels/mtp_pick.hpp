// The MTP draft's pick on the GPU: the largest logit (lowest index on a tie), the runner-up's value (the multiset
// second - equal to the best on a tie, -inf for one logit) and whether any logit is NaN - serve/sampler.hpp top2()'s
// result for non-NaN rows - written with the forward's error words into one small struct, so a draft step ends with
// one ~64-byte copy to the host instead of five copies and the whole draft vocabulary's logits (256 KB for 65536 ids)
// scanned on the CPU. A 2026-09-28 trace of the draft loop (tools/trace_gaps.py) had ~0.3 ms of each ~1.2 ms draft
// step idle around those copies and the host scan.
